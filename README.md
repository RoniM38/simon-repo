Simon Game

This game is based on the "Simon" memory game.
For info on the game, visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)

Description:
There are four different colored buttons on the screen. In each round, the program will randomly choose a button. The button will automatically be clicked. You will need to
remember which button was clicked and click that button. If you click the right one, the game will continue. Else, it will end. In every round, another button will be randomly
chosen and added to a sequence. The sequence will get longer and longer each round. Your score will be counted and displayed on the screen.

Enjoy ;)
