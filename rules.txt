This game is based on the "Simon" memory game.
There will be four different colored squares on the
screen. The game will consist of a few rounds. In each
round, the game will randomly choose one of the squares.
The chosen square will light up and a sound will be played.
The chosen square will then be added to a sequence. The
sequence will be played in each round after a new square
is added to it. You will have to remember the sequence and
click the right squares according to the sequence. If you
click the wrong square, the game will end. Good luck!
